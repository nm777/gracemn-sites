**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: January 15, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

All specification quality criteria have been met:

- Requirements are now testable with objective criteria (FR-001 specifies minimum font size, FR-006 specifies consistency attributes)
- Assumptions section added documenting key assumptions about infrastructure, audience, and design expectations
- All mandatory sections are complete and well-defined

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
